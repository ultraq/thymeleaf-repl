Thymeleaf REPL
==============

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-repl/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-repl/actions)

A website for being able to try out snippets of Thymeleaf code.

A REPL stands for ["read-eval-print loop"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop),
and is an interactive environment that takes some input, executes it, and prints
it back out to you.  Such environments are often included with scripting
languages, and many JavaScript libraries have such a feature on their websites
because the browser is the runtime necessary to demonstrate the library.  Having
had to answer lots questions for Thymeleaf, I wished for a similar environment
for Thymeleaf, so this website aims to be just that for me.

This was hosted on Heroku, but I've since taken it down when they removed their
free tier offering.  This can be run as a local Spring Boot app instead.
