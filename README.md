Thymeleaf REPL
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-repl.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-repl)

A website for being able to try out snippets of Thymeleaf code.

A REPL stands for "read-eval-print loop", and is an interactive environment that
takes some input, executes it, and prints it back out to you.  Such environments
are often included with scripting languages, and many JavaScript libraries have
such a feature on their websites because the browser is the runtime necessary to
demonstrate the library.  Having had to answer lots questions for Thymeleaf, I
wished for a similar environment for Thymeleaf, so this website aims to be just
that for me.
